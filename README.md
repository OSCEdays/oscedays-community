Description
OSCEdays is a global, open network that hosts innovators and projects that explore the convergence of Open Source and Circular Economy. It started with a kickoff 2015 global event June 11-15 that drew  33 participating cities and the creation of a web platform. The work continues to develop a global community and actions for an Open Source based Circular Economy. 
Objectives
The overall objective is to stimulate a debate and practical action towards a Circular Economy built with Open Source methodologies
Background
There is growing consensus that we must transition towards a circular economy in order to mitigate serious environmental and resource shortage challenges which modern civilization faces. While there has been a global drive to migrate towards a circular economy, much less attention has been given to the question of what type of circular economy is desirable. In particular, it is entirely possible to circularize the entire economy and maintain the extreme levels of global wealth inequality. An open source circular economy can address both environmental and socio-economic injustice simultaneously by democratizing the means of production.
