How to Contribute during #mozsprint
Promote our event
Promote OSCEDay June 2018 event on Facebook or on Twitter (link coming soon)
Join or host a local event at the upcoming June 2018 OSCEdays
Join an existing June 2018 event in your city
If you or a group of colleagues would like to join this year’s event, go to the oscedays webpage and see if your city is included in this year’s event. If it is, browse the projects that local organizers are planning for this year, or add your own idea and invite others to join you.
Collaborate with other innovators remotely
If participating locally is out of the question, then you can remotely join and collaborate on any existing project on the website. Or, ideate your own project and invite others to join you!
Host a local June 2018 event
If there is no event in your city and you would like to try hosting an event, click on Add Your City link on the oscedays page and follow the instructions to join as a local organizer. We are always looking for local champions to build a circular economy for all! Contact us and we can step you through the process.
Join the OSCEdays Board Of Stewardship
Join us and help us to plan, promote and exemplify the power of open source circular economy. The OSCEdays are guided by a Board of Stewardship (BoST) – an open international group of members using a transparent workflow to develop the OSCEdays. Members are open to join this group at any given moment. Learn more about the BoST, how it works and how to join HERE.
Browse our website and give us feedback for ways to improve it
Another way to help us is to review our current website and give us feedback of what’s working and what’s not.
